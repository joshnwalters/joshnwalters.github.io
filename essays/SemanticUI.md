If you're like me, you are a novice at best when it comes to web development. I myself just a week ago was only able to create web pages that were cutting edge in 1996. I have fond memories of the 90's, but I don't want to take future customers on a trip down memory lane when they view the product I'm trying to create for them. For a an idea of what I'm talking about, you can see some websites from the 90's that are still active [here](http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/), [here](http://www.dolekemp96.org/main.htm), or [here](http://www.fogcam.org/). (The fog cam still updates 25 years later!)


With Semantic UI, your webpages can easily be converted from ugly blue hyperlinks, goofy icons, and pixelated pictures, like the still active CNN O.J. Simpson trial page in the hyperlink above to something modern and  sleek.
