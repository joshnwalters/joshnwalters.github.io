 My relationship with Javascript started out much like any other relationship. At first, communication was painful. I was speaking to Javascript a lot like I had spoken to my previous programming languages. Luckily, Javascript didn't seem to let it become a bother. In the beginning, I was too hung up on my previous relationships (Java, C++). I said "Look, my previous relationship got kind of messy, Java was really controlling. Java was always trying to force me to return just one data-type in my functions." I was relieved when Javascript replied, "Look, you're your own person. While we're together, I'll let you return whatever you want: Booleans, integers, strings, it's totally up to you."
   
   function returnWhatever(integer) {
	    switch(integer) {
  	    case 0:
    	    return 1;//returns an integer
          break;
        case 1:
    	    return true;//returns a boolean
        default:
    	    return: "It's ok, return whatever you want!";//returns a string
  }
}
   
   
   
   I knew I was dealing with a free spirit, which certainly peaked my interest. Then, however, Javascript told me about variables. "I don't like to be bogged down by declaring a type for variables," Javascript said. This left me somewhat bothered, I tried to hide my emotions as Javascript continued to speak. "Also, I don't want my arrays to be exclusive, you know, just one data type?" I couldn't hold my tongue. "Free love and variables might have been OK in the sixties, but I grew up in a conservative home. Besides, Java and I never had any problems with just one type of variable in our arrays!" Although I raised my voice, Javascript remained calm. "Calm down," Javascript said. "If it makes you happy, we can have exclusive arrays, but I really want you to give them a chance."
   
   
   let variable = [1, 'shoe', true, 3.14];//four different data types in one array!!!!
    
    
    
    Javascript's calm, cool reply brought me back to my senses, I decided I'll keep an open mind, try to experience something new. "Alright," I retorted, "I'll try to live with your wild array lifestyle." "I'm glad you feel that way," Javascript said with a grin that I knew meant I was in for a surprise. "If you stay with me, I'll show you .push(), .pop(), .shift(), and .unshift()." By the look Javascript was giving me, I knew I should be happy, but honestly, I had no idea what Javascript was talking about. Before I could get a word out, Javascript said "I have built in functions to use an array as a stack or queue, didn't you ever use those with your last programming language?" Javascript's words brought back painful memories of null pointer exceptions, methods, and classes, all to build data structures that were just so simple in Javascript. "yeah," I replied, "Java and I didn't really see eye to eye on data structures, it really strained our relationship." Javascript said "Don't worry, I'll make data structures way more fun." It was at this moment that I realized I was falling for Javascript. Just as everything seemed perfect, she mentioned a name that echoed in my head the rest of the night.
    
    let variable = [1, 'shoe', true, 3.14];
    
    variable.pop();//this will pop the value 3.14 from the array, just like a stack
    
    variable.push(3.14);//this pushes 3.14 back on the end of the array
    
    variable.unshift();//removes the first item from the array, and shifts the remaining values to the left one space (like a queue)
    
    variable.shift(1);//puts 1 back at the front of the array, shifting everything else one to the right
   
   
   
   "JSON," the only words I understood out of the whole sentence. "Who is JSON!?" I sharply recited, interrupting Javascript. "I said, I need to tell you about JSON." My heart began to race, who is this JSON character? Javascript's ex? My mind began wander to the worst cases. "JSON is Javascript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data-interchange format. It can store integers, floats, strings, booleans, a NULL value, or even objects. Look, I know you're going to struggle to get to know JSON, but I really think it would be best for our relationship if you two could be friends." I sank back in my chair. I couldn't tell whether Javascript was a gift from above, or a wild-child that would ruin my trust in programming languages all together.
