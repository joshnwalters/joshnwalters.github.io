How Get Answers From Your Question

>"There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is >a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question"
Carl Sagan

Dr. Sagan had a great view on questions: They are just a way of trying to better understand the world. No matter how trivial or outlandish they may be, a question is just a request for better understanding. Unfortunately, this logic is not shared by the people you will sooner or later come into contact with when trying get assistance with a bug, or whatever other problem you may find in your computer science career. Hell hath no fury like an army of people behind keyboards, so to prevent you from feeling this wrath, I present a few examples of "good" questions, and "bad" questions

>i want to return a double however it always returns an integer. this code returns 10.0, I want the decimals as well

>I have tried using a different public variable,
```Javascript
     public double getCost()
        {
            double price = 500/46; 
            return price;
        }
        ```
 >I want to get decimals. I hope to get 10.869...

 This question seems pretty solid, the verbage is easy to understand, code is formatted so that it's easy to read, and he even posts what his desired return value is. This question becomes a bad question in that a quick search of "The Java Tutorials" on Oracle's website could have provided the necessary information much faster than posting and waiting for a response.

This question I found in Meta StackExchange under a thread called "What is a "Bad" question". Answering this question would require a textbook. There is no way of determining what level of knowledge the individual who asked the question. Is he a novice programmer, trying to understand at a high-level view? Perhaps an expert who encountered a bug? Intuition leads us to the first answer, but we have no way of knowing for sure. The second thing I notice is spelling. It's always a good idea to run a spell-check with any one of the many
