The process of constructing a professional persona is not unfamiliar to me. Upon completing military service, every sevice-member regardless of branch goes through training to prepare for reentry into the civilian workforce. This process is often unsettling, as many people begin to realize their resumes are lacking, and their professional portfolio is non-existant.


Although I have been through a much more generic form of this process, not geared to finding a career in software engineering, I still found the value of spending the time to reevaluate my online presence. My linkedin account was out of date. The resume I had was missing my most recent employment, and made almost no mention of my education. It also lacked any keywords that would associate me with programming or computer science, which nowadays is paramount if you want to have a hiring manager even skim your coversheet.


When it comes to the portfolio portion, I can already see how powerful of a tool this can be. Linkedin is great, but there are links all over the page to other people, distracting them from the main attraction, in this case, ME! Techfolio creates a nice, clear picture of myself linked to my Github profile. It concisely describes all of my interests and aspirations, with easily accesible links to essays, projects, and an abbreviated version of my resume. Best of all, in contrast with Linkedin, there are no news articles speaking of government shutdowns, or "Five Things Your Boss Wants to Hear."


Overall, the process was wildly beneficial. I would highly recommend anyone reading this, regardless of where they are in the professional career to take the time to knock the dust off the old resume, and make sure it conveys information about who you are as an employee and as an individual. This also works to make you aware of any area where you may be lacking.
